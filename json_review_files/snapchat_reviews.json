Once you've used it on an iOS, you'll realise the amount of features it lacks on Android. These features include but are not limited to: Bounce Videos, Camera Night Mode, Multi-Filters, and Snap Appearance Preview while editing and adding stickers. Also, the image quality compared to one taken by the stock Camera app is significantly low and bad unlike, again, the iOS version. Same goes for the video quality in addition to the substantially low frame rate.</span></div>",

To bad you screwed up such a good thing!</span></div>",
