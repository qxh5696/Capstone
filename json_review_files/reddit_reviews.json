I started using the app after they started displaying a message on mobile saying that the subreddits I used to visit were now only visible in the app. A positive thing about the app is that is requires no permission upon installing. It was only when I tried to submit an image that it asked for access to my files and photos. But for me the app deserves a bad rating because of the way it handles collapsing comments. In the mobile version of the site, the way we collapsed comments were by taping in the \"header\" of the comment (where the username and timestamp appears). This provided two very useful functionalities: (1) being able to preview a link and (2) being able to copy part of a comment. Now, there is NO WAY to check the URL of a hyperlink in a comment. You have to to take a leap of faith. reddit is teaching us to click a link uncritically, which IMO is a huge disservice to the best security practices. And now you can only copy an entire comment, not just the part you want. If I have to switch to the web version every once in a while, this issue has rendered the app barely usable for me.</span></div>",
